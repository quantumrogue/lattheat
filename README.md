# LatticeGPU.jl: A framework for lattice computations on the GPU

This is a library/code to simulate the pure `SU(N)` gauge theory on
GPUs. 


## Changes to SU(2) Higgs 

- Compatibilized with master branch:
    - Flow integrators;
    - YM workspace;
    - Scalar functions changed accordingly.
- Added two point correlation functions for the Higgs and W-bosons
